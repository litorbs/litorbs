## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/litorbs
cd Litorbs

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from Litorbs import Agent, Environment

# Create an agent
agent = Agent(
    cognitive_architecture="transformer",
    learning_rate=0.001,
    memory_size=10000
)

# Create an environment
env = Environment(
    type="dynamic",
    complexity="adaptive"
)

# Train the agent
agent.train(
    environment=env,
    episodes=1000,
    goals=["maximize_reward", "minimize_risk"]
)

# Deploy the agent
agent.deploy(
    task="complex_decision_making",
    monitoring=True
)
```
